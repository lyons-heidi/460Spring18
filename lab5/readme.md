1. Download samples/c7.4.forkexec.tgz

   It contains fork-exec as in Unix/Linux.
   The Umode image size of each process is again assumed to be 1MB.

Modify the system to support Umode image size of 4MB.

2. Section 7.7.10 covers vfork(). It lists the algorithms of
   vfork() and exec() adapted for vfork().

Implement and demonstrate vfork() and exec()  on the base code of c7.4.forkexec.tgz.
